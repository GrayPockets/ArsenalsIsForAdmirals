# Arsenals is for Admirals

## Description

The Arsenals from "More Maritime: Seaside Sectors" are powerful, but Harbors still provide a lot of the same benefits they always did. This mod finishes moving military affairs to the Arsenals, leaving the Harbor for trading functions.

* Harbors and Harbor buildings no longer give Great Admiral Points (except the Royal Navy Dockyard district)
* The Great Lighthouse requires an adjacent Arsenal instead of a Harbor
* The Great Lighthouse and Colossus swap tech positions to match their aligned districts
* Colossus gives Great Merchant Points instead of Great Admiral Points
* Torre de Belem gives Great Merchant Points instead of Great Admiral Points
* Remove the Harbor district project
* Add an Arsenal district project that provides Great Admiral Points
* The Statue of Liberty requires an adjacent Waterfront instead of a Harbor

## Requirements

* Expansion: Rise and Fall
* Expansion: Gathering Storm
* More Maritime: Seaside Sectors
